# Multimedia-Information-Retrieval
- Coursework for my Multimedia Information retrieval module. The python code in Retrieval has two main classes, one is a boolean retrieval and the other is ranked retrieval. The explanation behind the code in the jupyter file.
- To run this I reccomend you clone the repo and open the retrieval file and run that. It will automatically run the ranked retrieval with a sample query.
